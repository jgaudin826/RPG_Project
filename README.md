## RPG_Project

# Overview

The goal was to create a command line RPG with TypeScript where characters are controlled by players and monsters have simplistic AI. The code must be OOP and there must be no more than 10 lines of code outside a class.

The another goal was to validate the skills acquired in OOP and work them arounda complete project divided into stages.


# Skills measured

- Draw a class diagram.
- Set up a command line application.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use of class and instance OOP concepts.
- Mastery of the concept of inhetirance and polymorphism.
- Use of intermediate OOP concepts (crashing classes, interfaces, abstract classes...).
